# ML_classficiation-feature_extraction_template
This is a template for me to perform ML_classficiation&amp;feature_extraction using sklearn
It includes:
- the data overview, data exploration(class balance check), data processing, data cleaning 
- train-test split
- Try with established classficiation method (logistic regression, random forest, xgboost)
- hyper parameter tuning, cross validation
- feature ranking (intrinsic method like weight or permutation) and model interpretation (SHAP)
- reduce redundacy (mrmr)
- feature selection (forward backward)
